# verification-code

This code accompanies the paper "Unconditional computation of the class groups of real quadratic fields" by Ce Bian, Andrew R. Booker, Austin Docherty, Michael J. Jacobson, Jr., and Andrei Seymour-Howell, to appear in the proceedings of [LuCaNT](https://icerm.brown.edu/events/sc-23-lucant/).

The verification code can be built by running "make trace"

mpfr, gmp, zlib, flint and arb are all required dependencies.
