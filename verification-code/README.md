# verification-code
Here is a tarball with Bian's code and our verification code. A few notes:

Bian's code needs an installation of Holger Then's library for computing K-Bessel, which is included in a subdirectory.

I made some small changes to the QuadraticInfrastructureElement code, which is also bundled with the verification. Feel free to update it if there are any changes.

For the code to be of any use, one needs both the class group data and Maass form data.
